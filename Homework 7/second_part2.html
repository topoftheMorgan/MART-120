        <p>Hi! My name is Morgan and I am a Media Arts student. My highschool story was an absolute rollercoster of emotions. When i reached my seinor year, I finaly felt good about my self and didn't care what others thought of me. 
        <p>I have always been a nerd. I have gotten a lot of my interests from my older brother who got me into my nerdy intrests. To practice my drawing, I like to draw charicters from the anime I watch.</p>
